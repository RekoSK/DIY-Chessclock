# DIY Chessclock
 My homemade chessclock for RP2040 (coded in circuitpython), which I created for fun. Code is kinda messy, cuz I never thinked that I will publish it, but my plans changed because I joined to the [summer of making contest](https://summer.hackclub.com/).

### Anyways, this code features:
- Fully functional chess clock :D
- Menu, where you can change the increment and time of both players
- Chess960 (Freestyle chess) position generator
- Buzzer implementation
- Pause menu
- Setting menu
- and some more smaller things

Hope you gonna enjoy this cheap way to make a chess clock, also this one isn't with any license whatsoever so you can use it however you want.
